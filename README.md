## Train Schedule
For this assignment, we had to create a train schedule with persistent data. Using Google's Firebase for the database, we implemented the persistent data. You can also add a train to the schedule that will live in the database. The "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" data are calculated using the Moment.js library.

## Personal Fouls
For this group project, we quickly decided to use an open API called NFL Arrests. This API is privately maintained and hosted by [Patrick Murphy.](http://resume.patrickmurphyphoto.com/) This web app lets you pick an NFL team that displays the players that have been arrested since 2000. When you click on the player's name, you get the player's arrest details along with their NFL highlights. Not only do we show you stats, but we also include a YouTube video for each set of stats.
<!-- 
We used 3 APIs for this project. NFLArrest, SortRadar and YouTube. We had a challenging time accessing the SportRadar API because of the player ID field.  -->
